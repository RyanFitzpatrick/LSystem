# LSystem

This software uses Quadtree based L-Systems to generate various height maps and save them as bitmap images for later rendering.
More details about the process can be found in "LSystem.pdf"

To build the solution simply run "make -C Build" in the project root directory. The project is written in ansi C and should compile
Anywhere where the C standard library and GCC are installed. After successfully building the solution, the code can be run from the project root
Using the command "./Main/Main". This will output the heightmap as a matrix, and also save a bitmap image of the heightmap in the Resources
Folder, under the name "heightmap.bmp".

To view a rendering of the bitmap image, we can use "Main.py". This file currently only supports rendering on Windows. Running "Main.py"
while in the "Main" folder will open a rotating view of the genrated landscape. You must be in the "Main" folder for this to work
correctly. This always requires that python be installed, along with the following packages: GLWindow, ModernGL, Pillow, and Pyrr, all of
Which can be installed with pip (pip install GLWindow, pip instal ModernGL, pip install Pillow, and pip install pyrr)
